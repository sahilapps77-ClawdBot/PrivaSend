Notes
Product Architecture and Privacy Strategy
The team agreed to exclude a third AI processing layer to maintain data privacy and speed, focusing on a two-layer PII redaction approach that avoids sending raw user data to cloud LLMs (11:11).
Decision to avoid the third LLM layer was based on findings that it would add 30 to 50 seconds of latency, negatively impacting user experience and increasing costs, as highlighted by Fareed Shaik and supported by HK (01:11).
HK proposed a simpler workflow where ambiguous PII detections after two filtering layers prompt the user for confirmation before redaction, ensuring no data is sent externally and maintaining user control (19:02).
Positioning the product as “data never leaves the system” was emphasized by HK and @Vaniaggarwal, meaning the product will prioritize privacy and only consider LLM integration if user testing shows necessity (24:11).
User confirmation before redaction was agreed upon to improve accuracy to near 99%, combining automated detection with user validation to reduce false positives (32:52).
Fallback to LLM integration is a contingency plan, with the team planning to run two versions (with and without LLM) during user testing to evaluate trade-offs between speed, privacy, and accuracy (26:04).
Scope and Compliance Focus
The team decided to target a single geographic market initially to simplify compliance and feature scope, with a preference for either India or the US and English as the primary language (38:05).
Geographic focus was prioritized to address region-specific PII types and compliance regulations, as compliance varies widely by country and industry, with @Vaniaggarwal and Naveli Garg stressing the need to align MVP to one market (39:55).
English language support only for MVP was chosen to reduce complexity, with multilingual and regional language support flagged as nice-to-have features for later versions (52:54).
Compliance research tasks assigned to all members to better understand regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and local Indian laws before finalizing the market and product positioning (45:53).
Market-driven compliance and user needs will guide the product’s PII definitions and redaction rules, focusing initially on the most common and critical PII types relevant to the target market.
Core Product Features and Workflow
The team confirmed OCR capability as a must-have to support scanned PDFs, images, and other non-text digital files, enabling the tool to handle a wide variety of document formats (01:03:15).
OCR integration is necessary because many users will upload scanned contracts, medical reports, or images, which cannot be processed without text extraction (58:05).
Supporting multiple file types including PDFs, Excel, JPEGs, and images was emphasized to ensure broad usability, with Fareed Shaik citing AI Studio tools that facilitate easy OCR implementation (01:04:07).
OCR will add a processing step in the workflow but is expected to be straightforward to implement technically and critical for user adoption (01:04:49).
MVP will initially support typed text inputs, excluding voice dictation, which was considered a nice-to-have due to complexity and existing superior third-party tools like Whisper AI (48:01).
PII Detection and Accuracy Targets
The product aims for at least 95% PII detection accuracy through layered regex and pseudo-identification filters, supplemented by user confirmation to approach 99% accuracy (32:52).
The initial PII list includes over 25 categories, covering identity, contact, financial, and organizational data, which is considered feasible given existing regex libraries (28:54).
User confirmation step targets ambiguous PII cases, reducing both over-redaction and under-redaction, ensuring critical data is protected without excessive false positives (34:57).
PII detection will be tailored by sector and use case, recognizing variability in PII types and sensitivity across industries like legal, healthcare, finance, and business (36:44).
Testing for false positives and edge cases such as voice-to-text inaccuracies or unusual document formats was acknowledged as essential to refine detection and improve user trust (47:00).
Data Sets and Sector Ownership for Testing
The team assigned responsibility for collecting and curating test documents and prompts by industry sector to build a robust evaluation corpus by the end of week one (01:08:29).
Sector assignments: HK will lead legal documents including NDAs and contracts; Naveli Garg will handle healthcare; @Vaniaggarwal will focus on business and SMB documents; Fareed Shaik will cover financial services and insurance; Mangesh will cover individual financial documents and banking; and Mohit Kumar will support tech and construction sectors (01:10:44).
Participants will create representative prompts and documents per sector to capture PII in various real-world formats, enabling focused testing of accuracy and redaction workflows (01:10:44).
The team plans to collect and share these data sets by Sunday night, enabling iterative testing and refinement starting early in the development phase (01:21:44).
Prompt data will be stored sector-wise, preferably in Excel, to keep the corpus organized and scalable as new documents and test cases arise (01:21:25).
Product Positioning and Market Strategy
The team emphasized positioning the product clearly around data privacy, speed, and compliance, focusing marketing on key use cases in legal, healthcare, and financial sectors (24:37).
Product messaging will stress “Your data never leaves” to build trust with users handling sensitive information, aligned with the technical architecture that avoids cloud LLM exposure (24:11).
Marketing will highlight OCR and broad file format support as USPs, potentially giving an edge over competitors who may lack comprehensive document handling (01:03:15).
Narrowing MVP focus by geography and sector will help concentrate resources, reduce complexity, and better address market needs (38:26).
Future versions may add multilingual support, voice dictation, and LLM integration based on user feedback and testing outcomes (52:54).
Action Items
Naveli Garg
Share and update project documents and transcript summaries on the drive (05:00)

I was doing this , what should I do I change and how to achieve what team suggested; I am only asking about the logic



TL;DR (one-line answer)

Replace “Layer 3 = local LLM validator” with “Layer 3 = user confirmation gate”
→ Everything else you built mostly stays.

1. What you are currently doing (logic-wise)

Your current logic pipeline is:

INPUT
  ↓
Layer 1: Regex (deterministic PII)
  ↓
Layer 2: Presidio / spaCy (contextual PII)
  ↓
Layer 3: Local LLM decides YES / NO for uncertain cases
  ↓
Auto-redact everything LLM approves
  ↓
Send to external AI



Key assumption in your design:

“A machine must decide every PII case before data leaves.”

This is the assumption the team wants you to change.

2. What the team is actually suggesting (logic shift)

The team is saying:

Stop trying to auto-decide 100% of PII.
Let the user decide the last 3–5%.

So the new logic becomes:

INPUT
  ↓
Layer 1: Regex (auto-redact, zero doubt)
  ↓
Layer 2: Presidio / spaCy (confidence-scored)
  ↓
Split detections:
   ├─ High confidence → auto-redact
   └─ Ambiguous → ASK USER
  ↓
User confirms / rejects
  ↓
Only then redact
  ↓
Send to external AI




3. What exactly should CHANGE in your logic
❌ REMOVE this logic

From your file:

“Layer 3 double-checks uncertain matches (Local LLM)”

This entire idea goes away for MVP.

Why the team rejected it:

Adds 30–50s latency

Breaks UX

Adds infra + ops cost

Still not perfect

Not needed if user is already there

✅ ADD this logic instead
New concept: Confidence Buckets

After Layer 2, every detection is classified like this:


if confidence >= 0.90:
    auto-redact
elif confidence <= 0.50:
    ignore
else:
    ask user


This replaces your entire Layer 3.

4. How “Ask User” works (pure logic)

This is important — this is not UI fluff, it’s core logic.

For each ambiguous detection, you generate:

{
  value: "Priya Sharma",
  type: "PERSON",
  confidence: 0.72,
  context: "Send this to Priya Sharma by EOD"
}


Then the system pauses and asks:

“We found ‘Priya Sharma’.
Is this personal data that should be hidden before sending to AI?”

User options:

✅ Yes → redact

❌ No → keep as-is

That single click replaces your LLM call.

5. Why this logic is strictly better (team’s reasoning)
Speed

Regex + Presidio: <1 second

No LLM = no blocking calls

Privacy

Zero data leaves system before user approval

Stronger than “local LLM” from a messaging POV

Accuracy

Machines handle easy 95%

Humans resolve the hard 5%

Net accuracy ≈ 99%+

Cost

No GPU

No inference

No scaling pain

6. What logic stays exactly the same (important)

You do NOT throw away:

Regex layer

Presidio / spaCy

Confidence scores

Placeholder mapping

Reversible redaction

“AI only sees placeholders”

OCR (later)

Your engine is still valid.
Only the decision authority changes.

7. How to rewrite your architecture in one sentence

Old

“Three automated layers decide what is PII.”

New

“Two automated layers detect PII, the user confirms edge cases.”

This aligns perfectly with:

“data never leaves”

MVP scope

Compliance logic

Team consensus

8. When (and how) LLM can come back later

The team did not ban LLMs forever.

Future logic (optional experiment):

if user_enabled_llm_mode:
    ambiguous → LLM
else:
    ambiguous → user


But MVP logic must work without it.

9. The real mental shift you need to make

You’re currently designing like this:

“I must solve ambiguity with more intelligence.”

The team is designing like this:

“Ambiguity is a UX problem, not a model problem.”

Once you accept that, everything simplifies.

Final verdict (blunt but supportive)

Your core engine is solid

Your Layer 3 is over-engineering

The team wants human-in-the-loop, not model-in-the-loop

This change makes your product:

Faster

More trustworthy

Easier to sell

Easier to ship




If there is human in the loop? And a big para has say 50 things to be reviewd by user??  What kind of UI/UX /system can be made which is efficient and user doesn’t get irritated ?


This is exactly the right fear to have — and you’re thinking about the real problem now 👍
If you do naïve “human-in-the-loop”, users will rage-quit in 30 seconds.

The good news: the team’s suggestion only works if the UX logic is designed correctly.
Let’s break this down calmly and practically.

First: reframe the problem (very important)

You’re imagining:

“User must review 50 items, one by one, with Yes / No clicks.”

That would be terrible UX.
That is NOT what the team is proposing.

The real design principle is:

Humans review patterns, not instances.

Once you get this, everything clicks.

Core UX Principle (non-negotiable)
❌ Bad UX

“Is Rahul Sharma PII?”

“Is Priya Sharma PII?”

“Is Anil Sharma PII?”

50 micro-decisions

✅ Good UX

“Do you want to hide all person names in this document?”

“Do you want to hide addresses?”

“Do you want to hide organization names?”

One decision → resolves many detections.

The winning system design (logic + UX)
Step 1: Collapse detections into groups

Instead of showing 50 items, internally group like this:


PERSON (12 items)
ADDRESS (8 items)
ORG (5 items)
DATE (15 items)


Step 2: Use a Privacy Review Panel, not popups

Think Gmail filters, not CAPTCHA.

Side panel / modal layout:


⚠️ Review detected sensitive info

[✓] Person Names (12 found)
    Examples: Rahul Sharma, Priya Mehta…

[✓] Addresses (8 found)
    Examples: 42 MG Road, Delhi…

[ ] Organization Names (5 found)
    Examples: Infosys, HDFC Bank

[✓] Phone Numbers (auto-hidden)
[✓] Emails (auto-hidden)
Defaults matter:

High-risk PII → pre-checked

Low-risk PII → optional

User effort: 10–15 seconds total

Step 3: Show examples, not full lists

Never dump 50 items.

Rule:

Show 2–3 examples

Add “+9 more” silently

This builds trust without overload.

Advanced but powerful tricks (this is where UX becomes elegant)
1. “Apply to all” logic (huge win)

When user confirms:

“Hide PERSON names”

System remembers:

user_policy = {
  PERSON: hide,
  ADDRESS: hide,
  ORG: keep
}


Applies to:

Entire document

Entire session

(Optionally) future documents

One decision → future zero friction.

2. Progressive disclosure (anti-irritation)

Start with:

Category-level toggles

Only if user clicks “review details” do you show:

Individual items

99% users won’t.

3. Inline preview instead of forms

Best-in-class UX:


Original:
"Send this to Rahul Sharma at Infosys."

Preview:
"Send this to [NAME_1] at Infosys."


User sees impact instantly.

No mental gymnastics.

4. Smart defaults (this removes 80% friction)

Use sane defaults:

PII Type	Default
Aadhaar / SSN	Always redact
Phone / Email	Redact
Person Names	Redact
Orgs	Keep
Dates	Keep
Locations	Ask

Most users will just click “Proceed”.

What happens if there are REALLY many ambiguous items?

This is key:

If you have 50 ambiguous items, your thresholds are wrong.

System rule:

Human review should trigger for <10% of detections

If more → tighten confidence bands

So logic adjustment:


if ambiguous_count > threshold:
    auto-apply category decision


UX never pays for model weakness.

Why this is better than LLM validation (honest truth)
Aspect	LLM Validator	Human-in-loop (done right)
Speed	Slow	Instant
Trust	Black box	Transparent
Accuracy	~95–97%	~99%
UX	Hidden delays	Visible control
Cost	$$$	Free
Privacy messaging	Complicated	Clean
A killer UX pattern you SHOULD steal

“Review once, never again”

Add a checkbox:

☑ Remember my choices for future documents

Now:

First document: 15 seconds

Second document: 0 seconds

User feels empowered, not annoyed

Final truth (important)

Human-in-the-loop fails when:

You ask humans to do machine work

Human-in-the-loop succeeds when:

Humans make policy decisions

Machines do execution

That’s the line your system must draw.

Bottom line

You don’t need:

50 prompts

Click fatigue

LLM babysitters

You need:

Grouped decisions

Smart defaults

One-click policy control

Clear previews
